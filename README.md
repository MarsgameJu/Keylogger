# Keylogger Project

A simple and lightweight keylogger built with Python, utilizing the `pynput` library. This tool records every key press and saves it to a file for later review.

## Features
- Logs all key presses to a specified file.
- Runs silently in the background without opening a console window.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

3. Optionally, modify the script to update the file path where the key presses will be saved.

## Usage

### Running the Script
To run the keylogger, simply:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Execute the `.bat` file or navigate to your script directory and run:

   ```bash
   start pythonw.exe path\to\your\script.py
   ```

This will run the script in the background, without a console window appearing.

### Customizing Key Press Storage
By default, key presses are saved in `keyfile.txt`. You can customize the file path in the script to store the logs wherever you prefer.
