# Keylogger Project

A simple keylogger written in Python using the `pynput` library. This program logs all key presses to a file.

## Features
- Logs key presses to a file.
- Can run in the background without showing a console window.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script.
2. Install the required Python library:

   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

3. Modify the script (if needed):
   - Update the file path where key presses will be saved in the Python script.

## Usage

### Running the Script
To run the script:

1. Open a terminal (command prompt).
2. Execute the `.bat` file:

   ```bash
   start pythonw.exe path\to\your\script.py
   ```

This will run the script in the background without opening a console window.

### Storing Key Presses
The key presses are saved in a file (e.g., `keyfile.txt`). You can modify the script to change the file path where the key presses are stored.
